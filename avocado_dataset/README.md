## Introduction

SQL operators are a fundamental part of SQL queries, enabling us to perform various operations on data. This project serves as both a learning resource and a practical example of how SQL operators can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Ensure you have a SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) installed.
3. Import the provided avocado sales dataset into your database.
4. Open your SQL client and connect to your database.

## Usage

Explore the SQL scripts in this repository to see how different SQL operators are used to analyze the avocado sales dataset. You'll find examples of SQL operators such as arithmetic operators, comparison operators, and logical operators applied to calculate the percentage of small bags of avocados out of the total bags sold.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the SQL queries to deepen your understanding of SQL operators.
